# Tic Tac Toe
This is the code for a simple tictactoe game made with python. This game can run on any IDE, I used VSCode.

## How to play
In the game two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.   
No pre-requisites to run the game.   
Game stops as soon as one player wins or a tie occurs.
For this specific game, please enter the numbers 1-9 to choose which grid box you want to place your marker in. Game starts with X.

This can be used to understand the grid numbers.
